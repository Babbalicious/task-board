# Task Board

## Purpose

This is a simple task board application that allows users to create tasks by their due date, and place them into columns based on their progress. Users press the Create Task button, then enter a name, due date, and description of the task. The task is placed in the to-do column. Users can drag the task into the "In Progress" or "Done" columns. The tasks change to yellow when the due date is today, and red if the due date has already passed.
