# Task Board

## Purpose

Create a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with dates. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

SO THAT I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project progress accordingly
